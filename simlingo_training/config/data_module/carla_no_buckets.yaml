# CARLA dataset configuration without bucketed sampling
# Uses uniform random sampling across all driving scenarios
# Simpler than bucketed sampling but may result in imbalanced training data

defaults:
  - driving  # Base driving configuration

# No train_partitions defined - all data is sampled uniformly at random
