# Bucketed sampling configuration for CARLA dataset (version 12)
# This defines training data partitions to ensure balanced sampling across different driving scenarios
# Each bucket has a sampling probability that determines how often scenarios from that bucket are used

defaults:
  - driving  # Base driving configuration

# Training partition sampling probabilities
# Values sum to ~1.0 and determine the relative frequency of each scenario type in training batches
train_partitions:
  # General driving scenarios
  all: 0.082  # General/uncategorized driving data

  # Acceleration-based partitions (for diverse speed control learning)
  acceleration_negative_5: 0.03  # Hard braking: acceleration < -5 m/s^2
  acceleration_negative_1: 0.03  # Moderate braking: -5 m/s^2 < acceleration < -1 m/s^2
  acceleration_positive_1: 0.03  # Gentle acceleration: 1 m/s^2 < acceleration < 5 m/s^2
  acceleration_positive_5: 0.03  # Strong acceleration: acceleration > 5 m/s^2

  # Lateral control partitions (for turning and lane change diversity)
  lateral_control_1_2: 0.12  # Moderate turning: waypoint y-offset between 0.1 and 1 meter
  lateral_control_higher_5: 0.12  # Sharp turns: waypoint y-offset > 5 meters

  # Start/stop scenarios
  start_from_stop: 0.07  # Vehicle starting from standstill

  # Object interaction scenarios (vehicles)
  vehicle_front: 0.04  # Vehicle directly in front
  vehicle_side: 0.08  # Vehicle beside ego vehicle
  leading_object_vehicle: 0.09  # Following another vehicle

  # Traffic control scenarios
  leading_object_traffic.stop: 0.07  # Approaching stop sign
  leading_object_traffic.traffic_light: 0.07  # Interacting with traffic light

  # Pedestrian scenarios
  leading_object_walker: 0.05  # Pedestrian near or crossing path

  # Navigation scenarios
  changed_route: 0.08  # Route replanning/changes

  # Special scenarios
  parkinglane: 0.008  # Parking lane navigation
